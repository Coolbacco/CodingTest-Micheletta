# CodingTest-Micheletta
This is the coding test of Stefano Micheletta

You will find 3 files.txt:

**Estimated Time.txt** : contains 2 estimates of the time it took to develop the various aspects of the project, one that was written before the start and the other with the actual time the development took;

**Instruction for Game Designer.txt** : in this file I explain what the variables in the .json files represent, so that they can be modified at will to test different possibilities;

**Movement.txt** : I thought that the part of the script concerning the movement needed a more detailed explanation, which is inside this .txt .

The.json files can be found in **Assets>Resources**
